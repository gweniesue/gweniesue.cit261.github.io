                    <h3>Chapter 11 Further Functions</h3>
                    <li><b>Immediately Invoked Function Expression</b>– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous 
                        function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily 
                        achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use 
                        parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, 
                        which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses</li>
                    <li>Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only 
                        available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. </li>
                    <li>An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again. 
                        Because the code is only run once, there’s no need to create any reusable, named functions, 
                        and all the variables will also be temporary. An IIFE will be invoked once, and can set up 
                        any variables, objects and event handlers when the page loads. </li>
                    <li><b>Pure Functions:</b> A key aspect of functional programming is its use of pure functions. A pure 
                        function is a function that adheres to the following rules:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1) The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. 
                                It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.</li>
                            <li>2) There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data 
                                elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and 
                                returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data.</li>
                            <li>3) Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will 
                                always return the same result.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Functions have built-in properties such as length , but can have custom properties added.</li>
                    <li>All functions have <i>call()</i> and <i>apply()</i> methods that can invoke a function with the value of this 
                        bound to an object that is provided as an argument.</li>
                    <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses 
                        and immediately followed by double parentheses so they’re invoked. They are useful for namespacing 
                        variables and setting default values.</li>
                    <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending 
                        on certain conditions.</li>
                    <li>A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
                    <li>A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function.</li>
                    <li>Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means 
                        that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be 
                        completed.</li>
                    <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in 
                        sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</li>
                    <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
                    <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope 
                        of the function it was originally defined in.</li>
                    <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the <i>function</i> keyword.</li>
                    <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a <i>next()</i> method, which 
                        returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>
                    <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied 
                        as a series of functions.</li>
                    <li>Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, 
                        have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments 
                        (referential transparency).</li>
                    <li>Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a 
                        function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.</li>

                    <h3>Chapter 13 AJAX</h3>
                    <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
                    <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
                    <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>
                    <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
                    <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
                    <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create 
                        your own response objects.</li>
                    <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about 
                        the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
                    <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request 
                        or response object.</li>
                    <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
                    <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
