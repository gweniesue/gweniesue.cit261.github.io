                <li>This in a global context<br>
                    When <i>this</i> is called outside of any function, in a global context, 
                    this defaults to the Window object in the browser.</li>
                <li>This in object construction<br> 
                    When you create a new instance of an object with the new keyword, <i>this</i> 
                    refers to the instance.</li>
                <li>This in an object method<br>
                    Methods are fancy words for functions that are associated with an object, 
                    <i>this</i> within any method refers to the object itself.</li>
                <li>This in a simple function<br>
                    Simple functions are functions you know extremely well. Anonymous functions 
                    written in the same form are also considered simple functions. On browsers, 
                    this is always set to Window in a simple function. The same is true even if 
                    you call a simple function in an object method.</li>
                <li>This in arrow functions<br>
                    this in an arrow function is always the same as this around it (in its 
                    immediate scope). So, if you use arrow functions within an object method, 
                    the this context stays as the object, not Window.</li>
                <li>This in event listeners<br>
                    this is set to the element that fired the event in an event listener</li>
