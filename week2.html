            <li><b>Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY</b>, is a principle of programming 
                that specifies that every part of a program should only be 
                written once. This avoids duplication and means there’s no 
                need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.</li>
            <li><b>Arrow functions</b> can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that 
                gives them their name. The parameters come before the arrow and 
                the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are 
                always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign 
                them to a variable.</li>
            <li>Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable 
                and function declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of 
                where they are defined.</li>
            <li><b>Use of Arrow Functions</b><br>
                You'll notice that arrow functions are frequently used to declare the callbacks 
                in these examples. This because they are short functions, often only taking up 
                one line, making them a good candidate for using the arrow notation.</li>
